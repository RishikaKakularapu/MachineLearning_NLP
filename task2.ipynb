      "Comment: dude, that's awesome what you are doing and you are already on the right track.  a colleague of mine was very large like you around your same age.  he maintained an okay social life on the internet but was depressed often.  he started college but ended up having to drop out because his grandfather died and was the breadwinner for his household.  his father left him when he was about 5 or 6 years old i believe.  when his grandfather passed away due to complications involving his weight, it was a wake up call for him.  his grandfather gave him a ring from when he was younger before he passed and he made it his goal to loose enough weight to fit that ring.  he started loosing weight by marching in place everyday in his room until he was winded.  those sessions grew longer and longer.  eventually he realized that he had a bad habit of snacking whenever he did anything such as play video games, watch tv, etc even though he wasn't hungry.  to fix this, he would pause and think before he had a snack and asked himself if he was really hungry or if he was just giving in to his bad habit of snacking for no reason.  if he wasn't hungry, he would just chew on ice chips.  with those two things alone as well as somewhat keeping track of calories, he has lost close to 200 lbs.  he carries before and after as well as progress pictures with him on his phone everywhere he goes and looks at them from time to time to keep him motivated.  he also still wears the same belt that he had when he was larger.  every time he puts a new hole in it to make it fit smaller he has a little celebration by having a really good cheat meal.  he now has 17 holes in that belt.  it's definitely possible to achieve what you want and i hope this story as well as these tips helps you out.  good luck and i wish you good health and a long life. \n",
