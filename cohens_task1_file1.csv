"Dude, that's awesome what you are doing and you are already on the right track.  A colleague of mine was very large like you around your same age.  He maintained an okay social life on the internet but was depressed often.  He started college but ended up having to drop out because his grandfather died and was the breadwinner for his household.  His father left him when he was about 5 or 6 years old I believe.  When his grandfather passed away due to complications involving his weight, it was a wake up call for him.  His grandfather gave him a ring from when he was younger before he passed and he made it his goal to loose enough weight to fit that ring.  He started loosing weight by marching in place everyday in his room until he was winded.  Those sessions grew longer and longer.  Eventually he realized that he had a bad habit of snacking whenever he did anything such as play video games, watch tv, etc even though he wasn't hungry.  To fix this, he would pause and think before he had a snack and asked himself if he was really hungry or if he was just giving in to his bad habit of snacking for no reason.  If he wasn't hungry, he would just chew on ice chips.  With those two things alone as well as somewhat keeping track of calories, he has lost close to 200 lbs.  He carries before and after as well as progress pictures with him on his phone everywhere he goes and looks at them from time to time to keep him motivated.  he also still wears the same belt that he had when he was larger.  Every time he puts a new hole in it to make it fit smaller he has a little celebration by having a really good cheat meal.  He now has 17 holes in that belt.  It's definitely possible to achieve what you want and I hope this story as well as these tips helps you out.  Good luck and I wish you good health and a long life.

Apparently his following is rather large enough that when he does these things they get hundreds of anonymous calls and death threats within hours following his arrest.

Because blogs, like MYSA are designed to generate clicks. /r/aww bans (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)These are not outliers, these are default subs, and just about every single one of them bans submissions from this or that source and all of them strictly curtail what sorts of content they will allow.

"Little late to the game here, but just in case you're still reading this thread...The degree by itself is pretty meaningless without experience or practical application. It also heavily depends on exactly what field you're trying to break into. Companies are going to want sample code / programs for devs, they'll want certifications for anything from project managers, to sysadmins, to account managers. 
The advantage that entering the college world does give you is on-campus or campus affiliated hiring programs. Lots of tech companies host job fairs and direct hire graduating students. Grads are much cheaper than an experienced hire, and the companies believe they can teach you everything you'll need to know from a technology standpoint. Most of these companies are also remote work, so you're not tied down to just what's available in the area. ",Not Technology-related

But I can tell you that in person jury trials are way more efficient. We have so many issues with Zoom trials in practice that it's crazy. I had a girl crawl into a room to coach a witness. I've had two witnesses use earbuds so they could get answers. In one instance, we noticed a juror mute and turn off her camera. Turns out she went to work. You see all those Reddit threads complaining about ISPs? Man, connectivity issues can create chaos. As a future court reporter, you will prefer everyone be present in person, lol.

Jury selection is much faster in person and, in my experience as a seasoned trial attorney, more effective at producing a truly fair jury. My longest trial was 14 days, so 2 and a half work weeks. That involved trying offenses from the 1980s and late 2000s simultaneously. Horribly complicated case. By Zoom, it would've been a month or more.
